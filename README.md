**APE-HE NeXus File to JSON Document Converter**

**Description:**

This script is designed to automate the tasks of **extracting** metadata from NeXus (`.nxs`) files generated by the Advanced Photoelectric Effect - High Energy (APE-HE) experiment, and the **mapping** of extracted metadata to a predifined JSON schema to generate a structured JSON document. The NeXus file is parsed using the Python library `H5py`, which allows to efficiently navigate and manipulate HDF5-based files like NeXus.

The current script processes individual NeXus files and zipped NeXus files from APE-HE experiments, transforming the extracted metadata into a structured `JSON` format or zipped `JSON` files suitable for storage.

**Inputs:**

- Path to the Schema file (`.json`):
A JSON schema that defines the desired structure of the output document.
- Path to the NeXus file (`.nxs`) or zipped NeXus files (`.zip`):
A NeXus file containing experimental metadata and data.
- Name of the output file (`.json`) for a single NeXus file input or (`.zip`) for zipped NeXus files input:
The desired name of the output file where the metadata document will be saved.

**Output:**

A structured JSON file containing the extracted metadata aligned with the schema.

**How to execute the script:**

- For single NeXus file:
  `python NexusMapping_cmdline.py <path_to_schema.json> <path_to_NeXus_file.nxs> <output_document.json>`
- For zipped NeXus files:
  `python NexusMapping_cmdline.py <path_to_schema.json> <path_to_zipped_NeXus_files.zip> <output_document.zip>`
